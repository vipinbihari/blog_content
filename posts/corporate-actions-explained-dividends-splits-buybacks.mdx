Have you ever logged into your demat account to see extra shares you didn't buy or noticed a stock's price suddenly fall without any apparent reason? These events are often the result of "corporate actions."

Corporate actions are decisions made by a company's board of directors that significantly impact its shares and, consequently, its shareholders. For any investor in the Indian stock market, understanding these actions is crucial. They can affect your portfolio's value, the number of shares you own, and even present new investment opportunities.

### Key Takeaways
*   **Dividends:** A share of the company's profits paid to you. The stock price typically drops by the dividend amount on the ex-dividend date.
*   **Stock Splits & Bonus Issues:** You receive more shares, but the total value of your investment remains the same. The price per share decreases, making it more affordable.
*   **Rights Issues:** You get the 'right' to buy more shares at a discount, helping the company raise capital.
*   **Buybacks & Mergers:** A company buying its own shares can boost the stock price. Mergers combine companies, and your shares may be swapped for shares in the new entity.

## Dividends: Your Share of the Profits

A dividend is a method for a company to distribute a portion of its earnings to its shareholders. Think of it as a reward for being a part-owner of the business. Companies typically pay dividends in cash, which is directly credited to the bank account linked to your demat account.

**Key Dates to Know:**
*   **Declaration Date:** The day the company's board of directors announces the dividend.
*   **Record Date:** The cut-off date set by the company to determine which shareholders are eligible to receive the dividend.
*   **Ex-Dividend Date (Ex-Date):** This is the most important date for investors. To be eligible for the dividend, you must own the stock *before* its ex-date. With the T+1 settlement cycle in India, the ex-date is typically one business day before the record date.
*   **Payment Date:** The day the dividend is actually paid to eligible shareholders.

**Impact on Stock Price:**
On the ex-dividend date, a stock's price usually drops by an amount roughly equal to the dividend paid per share. This happens because the cash paid out is no longer part of the company's assets, and the stock's value adjusts to reflect this outflow. For instance, if a stock trading at ₹500 declares a ₹10 dividend, its price will likely open around ₹490 on the ex-dividend date.

## Stock Splits and Bonus Issues: More Shares, Same Value

Both stock splits and bonus issues increase the number of shares an investor holds without changing the total value of their investment. The primary goal is to improve the stock's liquidity (ease of trading) and make it more affordable for retail investors.

### Stock Splits

A stock split divides existing shares into multiple new ones. For example, in a 2-for-1 split, each share you own is split into two. If you held 100 shares of a company trading at ₹1,000 each, you would have 200 shares trading at ₹500 each after the split. Your total investment remains ₹1,00,000.

The key feature of a stock split is that the **face value** of the share is also divided. If the face value was ₹10 before a 2-for-1 split, it becomes ₹5 after.

### Bonus Issues

A bonus issue is when a company gives existing shareholders additional shares for free, issued from its accumulated profits or reserves. For example, a 1:1 bonus issue means you get one extra share for every share you currently hold.

Unlike a stock split, the **face value** of the share remains unchanged in a bonus issue. The stock price adjusts downwards proportionally to keep the total investment value constant.

## Rights Issues: An Offer to Buy More

A rights issue is a way for a company to raise fresh capital. It gives existing shareholders the right, but not the obligation, to buy new shares, usually at a discounted price compared to the market rate.

**How it works:**
Shareholders receive 'rights' in proportion to their existing holdings (e.g., one rights share for every five shares owned). They have three choices:
1.  **Exercise the right:** Purchase the new shares at the discounted price.
2.  **Sell the right:** If the rights are tradable (known as Renounceable Rights), you can sell them on the stock exchange to other investors who want to buy the shares.
3.  **Let the right lapse:** Do nothing, in which case the right expires and becomes worthless.

A rights issue can lead to a dilution of ownership for shareholders who choose not to participate. It's vital to assess the company's reasons for raising money before subscribing.

## Buybacks and Mergers: Reshaping the Company

### Share Buybacks

A share buyback (or repurchase) occurs when a company buys its own shares from shareholders, either through the open market or a tender offer. This action reduces the number of shares outstanding in the market.

**Why do companies do this?**
*   To signal management's confidence that the stock is undervalued.
*   To improve financial ratios like Earnings Per Share (EPS) by reducing the share count.
*   To return surplus cash to shareholders.

For shareholders, a buyback can be positive as it reduces the supply of shares, potentially leading to a higher stock price. However, note that as per recent changes, income from buybacks is now taxed as dividend income in the hands of the shareholder.

### Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A)

A merger is the combination of two companies to form a new entity, while an acquisition is when one company takes over another.

For shareholders of the companies involved, an M&A event typically means their existing shares are converted into shares of the newly formed or acquiring company based on a pre-determined swap ratio. The impact on your investment hinges on the deal's terms and the future prospects of the combined business.

Understanding these corporate actions is a fundamental part of being an informed investor. Always monitor company announcements to stay aware of how your investments might be affected.
