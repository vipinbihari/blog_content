# Sensex Snaps 4-Day Winning Streak, Nifty Ends Flat in Volatile Session

Indian equity benchmarks experienced a day of consolidation and volatility on Tuesday, June 10, 2025, as the BSE Sensex snapped its four-day winning streak to close with minor losses, while the NSE Nifty 50 managed to eke out a fractional gain, marking its fifth straight day in the green.

## Market Performance Overview

The 30-share BSE Sensex concluded the trading day at 82,391.72, down by 53.49 points or 0.06%. The index had a choppy session, opening higher at 82,680.79 and even climbing further in early trade before succumbing to profit-taking, hitting an intraday low of 82,240.40.

On the other hand, the 50-share NSE Nifty 50 ended the day at 25,104.25, up by a mere 1.05 points. Despite the flat close, this extended its gaining streak to five consecutive sessions.

The overall market sentiment was cautious, reflected in the India VIX, a measure of market volatility, which fell by 4.61% to settle at 14.01 points, suggesting a slight decrease in expected near-term fluctuations.

Market breadth was relatively positive. On the BSE, 2,184 stocks advanced, while 1,813 declined, and 148 remained unchanged. Notably, 130 stocks hit their 52-week highs, while 31 touched their 52-week lows. A total of 288 stocks were locked in the upper circuit, with 181 hitting the lower circuit.

## Sectoral Movements and Broader Markets

The broader markets showed mixed performance. The Nifty Midcap 100 index closed flat with a positive bias, while the Nifty Smallcap 100 index managed to gain 0.14%. On the BSE, the Midcap index ended flat, and the Smallcap index rose by 0.3%.

Sectoral indices painted a mixed picture. The Nifty IT index was the standout performer, rallying 1.65% (or 1.7% as per another source), with major constituents like Tech Mahindra, Infosys, HCL Technologies, and TCS posting significant gains. The Nifty Media index also saw buying interest, closing up by 1.31% (or 1% by another account). The Nifty Power index gained nearly 1%.

Conversely, the Nifty Realty index was the top loser, declining by 1.14% (or 1%) due to profit-booking in stocks like Prestige Estates, Macrotech Developers (Lodha), Anant Raj, DLF, and Brigade Enterprises. Other sectors that faced selling pressure included Nifty Auto, Nifty Bank, Nifty Financial Services, and Nifty Oil & Gas, all closing in the red. The Nifty PSU Bank index also slipped by 0.7%, with all its constituents ending lower.

## Key Drivers and Market Catalysts

Several factors contributed to the day's market behaviour:

*   **Profit-Booking**: After a multi-day rally, investors chose to book profits, particularly in banking, energy, and other heavyweight stocks that had seen significant gains.
*   **Global Cues**: Mixed signals from global markets kept investors on edge. While there was underlying optimism from recent positive U.S. jobs data and ongoing U.S.-China trade talks, the progress of these talks is being closely monitored.
*   **RBI Policy Impact**: The market continues to digest the implications of the Reserve Bank of India's recent monetary policy actions, including a sharper-than-expected rate cut and liquidity easing measures announced in the previous week, which had initially buoyed sentiment, especially in rate-sensitive sectors.
*   **FII Activity**: Recent FII inflows had provided momentum to large-cap stocks, but flows can be fickle based on global risk appetite.

## Stock-Specific Action

Several individual stocks were in focus:

*   **Adani Power**: Shares zoomed around 6-8%, marking their fifth consecutive day of gains.
*   **Grasim Industries**: The stock surged over 4% following an upgrade by Morgan Stanley and was among the top Nifty gainers.
*   **ITD Cementation India**: Shares jumped approximately 9%, hitting a fresh 52-week high, after the company announced securing a significant contract worth â‚¹893 crore for a jetty project in Odisha.
*   **Suzlon Energy**: The stock saw some activity following a block deal on Monday where institutional investors bought a stake from promoters. However, some analysts also suggested booking profits in the stock.
*   **RattanIndia Power**: Shares surged by a significant 18% on unusually heavy trading volumes, prompting the BSE to seek clarification from the company.
*   **Avenue Supermarts (DMart)**: The stock slumped nearly 6% amid reports of a large block deal where around 16 lakh shares changed hands.
*   **Coforge**: Shares gained over 6% after JPMorgan initiated coverage with an 'overweight' rating, naming it a top pick in the IT sector.
*   **Tata Motors**: The auto major's stock climbed nearly 2% after announcing its investment plans for its passenger vehicle business, including EVs, over the next five years.
*   **Hindustan Zinc**: Shares rose as much as 4% ahead of its board meeting scheduled for June 11 to consider an interim dividend.

Among Sensex constituents, 16 out of 30 stocks settled lower. Top gainers included Tech Mahindra, Tata Motors, Infosys, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, and UltraTech Cement. Major losers were Asian Paints, Bajaj Finance, Tata Steel, Bajaj Finserv, ICICI Bank, Maruti Suzuki, and Reliance Industries.

## Expert Commentary

Market experts suggest a period of consolidation. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, noted that the Nifty is likely to consolidate in the 24,500-25,500 range in the near term, with no immediate triggers to push it beyond the upper band. He anticipates some profit-booking but believes ample liquidity will ensure that dips are bought. He also highlighted the market's attention on the U.S.-China trade talks.

Earlier in the week, Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, had pointed to the RBI's supportive policies, positive U.S. economic data, and optimism around trade talks as factors lifting global sentiment, with FII inflows boosting large caps.

## Currency and Commodities

The Indian Rupee showed strength, settling at 85.62 against the US dollar, up 4 paise from its previous close.
In the commodities market, global oil benchmark Brent crude climbed 0.39% to $67.19 a barrel.

## What to Watch Next

Investors will continue to monitor several key factors in the coming days:

*   **Global Economic Data**: Upcoming inflation data from the US (CPI for May due Wednesday) and India (CPI for May due Thursday) will be crucial for gauging global and domestic economic health and potential central bank responses.
*   **US-China Trade Developments**: Any concrete news or progress from the ongoing trade negotiations between the US and China will significantly impact market sentiment.
*   **FII/DII Flows**: The direction and quantum of institutional investor flows will continue to influence market trends.
*   **Monsoon Progress**: The advancement and distribution of the monsoon will be critical for the agricultural sector and rural demand, impacting broader economic sentiment.
*   **Corporate Announcements**: Specific company news, earnings (though largely out of season), and board meetings (like Hindustan Zinc's for dividend) will drive individual stock movements.
*   **Technical Levels**: For Nifty, the range of 25,000 (support) and 25,350-25,400 (resistance) will be watched. A decisive breach of 25,116 could open targets of 25,600 and 26,000 according to some technical analysts.

The market appears to be in a phase where it is balancing recent gains with global uncertainties and domestic economic cues. While underlying liquidity remains supportive, bouts of profit-taking and sector rotation are likely to continue.
