**A supposed ceasefire between Israel and Iran sent the Indian stock market on a rollercoaster today. The Sensex and Nifty initially surged on hopes of de-escalation in the Middle East, only to pare most gains as reports of ceasefire violations emerged, highlighting the market's acute sensitivity to geopolitical developments.**

Indian equity benchmarks experienced a tumultuous trading session on Tuesday, June 24, 2025. The day began on a high note, with markets rallying on positive global cues following the announcement of a "complete and total" ceasefire between Israel and Iran. This news brought a wave of optimism, easing concerns about a wider conflict and causing a sharp drop in global crude oil pricesâ€”a significant boon for an oil-importing nation like India.

### Morning Euphoria: Markets Soar on Peace Hopes

The 30-share BSE Sensex opened strong, at one point surging an impressive 1,121.37 points (1.36%) to hit an intraday high of 83,018.16. Similarly, the 50-share NSE Nifty 50 touched a multi-month high of 25,317.70. The rally was broad-based, with banking, financial services, auto, IT, and metals sectors posting gains of 1-2%. The broader market mirrored the sentiment, with the Nifty Midcap and Smallcap indices each rising nearly 1%.

This positive sentiment extended to the currency market. The Indian rupee appreciated sharply by 75 paise to close at 86.03 against the US dollar, a significant recovery from recent lows, driven primarily by the crash in crude oil prices.

### Afternoon Reversal: Violation Reports Trigger Sell-Off

The market's celebratory mood was short-lived. In the latter half of the session, reports surfaced suggesting the ceasefire had been violated. This news triggered a wave of profit-booking as caution returned, causing the indices to surrender most of their substantial morning gains in a swift reversal.

The Sensex ultimately closed at 82,055.11, up by a mere 158.32 points (0.19%). The Nifty 50 settled at 25,044.35, with a modest gain of 72.45 points (0.29%). This stark contrast to the day's highs underscored the fragile nature of the market's optimism.

### Sectoral Movers and Key Stocks

Despite the volatility, several stocks held onto their gains. Top performers in the Sensex pack included Adani Ports, Tata Steel, Kotak Mahindra Bank, UltraTech Cement, and Bajaj Finserv. Conversely, Power Grid, Trent, NTPC, and Maruti were among the top laggards.

The day's trading was a clear indicator of the market's sensitivity to global events, particularly those impacting oil prices. The initial rally was a direct consequence of relief from the ceasefire news, while the rapid reversal demonstrated that investors remain on edge.

### Investor Outlook: Navigating Geopolitical Headwinds

The market's direction in the coming days will likely be dictated by developments in the Middle East. Investors will be keenly watching for confirmation or denial of the ceasefire violation reports. Any further escalation could reignite oil price concerns and renew selling pressure.

From a technical standpoint, analysts suggest the Nifty 50 has strong support in the 24,800 to 24,750 range, while facing a hurdle at the 25,200 to 25,250 levels. A sustained move above this resistance will be crucial for any continuation of the uptrend.

Investors should brace for continued volatility and maintain a close watch on global cues. Tuesday's session was a classic example of how quickly market sentiment can shift, serving as a reminder of the importance of a cautious and well-researched investment approach in uncertain times.
