Monday, October 28, 2024, marked a much-needed breather for Indian stock markets. After bleeding for five consecutive sessions, the benchmark indices staged a spirited comeback, with banking heavyweights leading the charge. The **BSE Sensex surged 602.75 points (0.76%) to close at 80,005.04**, while the **Nifty50 climbed 158.35 points (0.65%) to settle at 24,380.80**.

The rally was no accident. Strong quarterly earnings from ICICI Bank, combined with bargain hunting after last week's brutal selloff and easing crude oil prices, created the perfect storm for a recovery.
